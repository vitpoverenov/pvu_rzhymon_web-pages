          Studies have shown that Cordyceps militaris contains compounds that can increase the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the body. 
          ATP is the primary energy currency of the body, and it is used in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and oxygen utilization.

          <p class="block__text">Increased oxygen delivery: Cordyceps militaris has been found to increase the amount of oxygen that the body can absorb and use during exercise. This is thought to be due to the vasodilatory effects of Cordyceps militaris, which can help improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to the muscles.</p>
